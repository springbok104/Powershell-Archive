# üõ†Ô∏è PowerShell Tools

An older collection of scripts I've put together to automate processes - from file watching to Active Directory onboarding. These aren't shiny demos; they‚Äôre solutions built around real needs and use cases. Some are still handy, others show where I've been. Most are commented, scoped, and readable‚Ä¶ with a few quirks included.
