.SYNOPSIS
    Monitors a folder for newly created .txt files, moves and renames them, and edits lines matching "JobDescription = ..." for formatting consistency.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script creates a FileSystemWatcher event to detect incoming text files in a specified directory.
    Upon detection, it:
      1. Renames the file using the current timestamp
      2. Moves it to a destination folder
      3. Searches for a specific line ("JobDescription = ...")
      4. Modifies the matched line to wrap the value in the appropriate quote format (single, double, or both)
      5. Logs actions and errors to the console and optionally to a log file

.EXAMPLE
    .\Watch-JobDescription.ps1 `
    -folder "C:\watch" `
    -destination "C:\destination" `
    -filter "*.txt" `
    -logpath "C:\logs\filewatcher-log.txt"

.NOTES
    Requires: PowerShell 5+, file access rights to target folders
    Customize the `$folder`, `$destination`, `$filter`, and `$logpath` variables at the top of the script

    DISCLAIMER:
    This script is intended for internal testing, lab environments, or self-directed automation.
    It is provided as-is, with no warranties or guarantees.
    Use with caution in live environmentsâ€”review all paths, credentials, and host configurations prior to execution.
