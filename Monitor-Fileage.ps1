.SYNOPSIS
    Monitors a specified folder for files older than a given number of minutes and sends an email alert if any are found.
.DESCRIPTION
    This PowerShell script scans a target directory for files matching a specific extension or filename pattern.
    If any matching files are older than the threshold defined by `$minutesOld`, it compiles a list and sends an alert via email.

    PROCESS:
        1. Scan the folder for files matching the specified extension(s) or filename pattern.
        2. Identify files older than the specified number of minutes based on LastWriteTime.
        3. Build a report listing the old files found and their age criteria.
        4. Send the report to a configured email recipient using SMTP authentication.

    VARIABLES:
        - `$minutesOld`      : Number of minutes after which a file is considered "old".
        - `$folder`          : Full path of the folder to monitor.
        - `$searchType`      : Set to `"pattern"` to enable filename pattern matching via `$searchPattern`; leave blank to use extension filtering only.
        - `$searchPattern`   : If enabled, defines the pattern (e.g., "*_*.csv") for file filtering.
        - `$fileType`        : Pipe-separated list of allowed file extensions (e.g., `"csv|xml"`).
        - `$mailUser`/`$mailPass` : SMTP credentials used to send the email alert.
        - `$mailTo`          : Recipient of the alert email.

.NOTES
    PowerShell version: 5.x or later recommended
    Requires access to an SMTP server for email notification.
    Ensure sensitive data (like passwords) are stored securely and not committed to public repositories.
